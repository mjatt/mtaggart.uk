  <h3>
    My name is Matt Taggart. I'm 19 years old and an currently live in my home country of England.
    <p>
      I'm a degree apprentice at Capgemini, studying Digital and Technology solutions at Aston University, and working as an Applications
      Consultant. I am priveleged to work on the London Buses account, which entails bug fixing and delivering customer service
      to a good standard. I have been in my role since September 2016, and I'm always looking for new ways to extend my knowledge
      and experience. I am expected to finish my degree in 2024.

      <p>
        I'm passionate about delivering high-quality work, and ensure that I am able to give my all into tasks that I am assigned.
        I started learning programming in 2016, and I'm constantly looking for ways to increase my knowledge of the subject.
        The great thing about my job, is the fact that I am able to learn practices at University and apply them to my work,
        whilst also learning practices from work and applying it to my Uni work!

        <p>
          I'm open to travelling in my role; it helps to shake things up and stops a job from becoming the average 9-5. I've been fortunate
          enough to travel to different destinations in my time at Capgemini, and it has been so insightful to see the different
          aspects of our company. I have helped out at multiple events to spread the word of our Degree Apprenticeships,
          including giving a speech to around 400 students on my own!
